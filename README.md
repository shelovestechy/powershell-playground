# PowerShell Playground

A personal learning playground and a growing PowerShell handbook.

This repo is where I build my understanding of PowerShell from the ground up.  
I keep notes, small experiments, rough scripts, and patterns that come up in real IT work.

This is not a place to try random things.  
The point is to slowly understand how PowerShell actually works:  
what happens under the hood,  
why things behave the way they do,  
and how to use it without guessing.

Some parts are messy.  
Some will be rewritten later.  
That’s expected.

## How I learn and why this looks the way it does

I focus on foundations first.  
I want to understand systems from the roots,  
through the trunk,  
and out to the branches —  
not just grab shiny one-liners without knowing what holds them up.

The main books guiding this learning path are:

- PowerShell in a Month of Lunches  
- PowerShell 101  

This repository works as a sandbox alongside that learning.  
I break things, test assumptions, write things down,  
and return later to see what actually stuck.

If some notes or scripts read like someone learning to walk,  
that’s because I am.  

This repo is about building real understanding,  
not polishing an image.

## What this repo is

A personal PowerShell handbook in progress.  

Notes and experiments made while learning and working.  

A safe place to test ideas and observe real behaviour.  

Slowly moving toward identity, access, and M365-related use cases.

---

## What this repo is not

A polished production module.  

A copy-paste script collection.  

A tutorial or course replacement.

This is learning in public, on purpose.

---

## Principles

Objects over text.  

Understand before optimizing.  

Scripts should survive being run twice.  

Errors should be visible, not hidden.  

Write things down so future-me doesn’t have to relearn them.

Small helper scripts and entry points.

[99-snippets](./99-snippets)  
One-liners, reminders, rough ideas.

[docs](./docs)  
Longer notes and explanations.

## Language note

Some parts are written in Finnish.  
That is intentional.  
Clarity for me comes before polish for others.

## Status

Active learning repository.  
Content changes as understanding improves.
