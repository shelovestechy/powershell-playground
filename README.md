# PowerShell Playground

A personal learning playground and a growing PowerShell handbook.

This repository is where I build my own understanding of PowerShell from the ground up.  
I collect notes, experiments, small scripts, and patterns that have proven useful — or at least educational — in real IT work.

This is not just a place to “try things”, but an attempt to assemble a coherent personal reference:
how PowerShell works, why it works that way, and how it can be used sensibly in day-to-day scenarios.

Some things will be rough, rewritten, or replaced over time. That is intentional.

## What this repo is
- My personal PowerShell handbook in the making
- A collection of study notes, small experiments, and practical examples
- A place to test ideas safely and see what actually happens
- Gradually shifting toward identity, access, and M365-related use cases

## What this repo is not
- A polished production-ready module
- A copy-paste script dump
- A step-by-step course or tutorial series

This repository reflects learning in progress.

## Principles
- Prefer objects over text
- Try to understand what actually happens under the hood
- Make scripts safe to re-run where possible
- Fail clearly instead of silently
- Write things down so future-me doesn’t have to rediscover them

## Structure
- `01-fundamentals/`  
  Core PowerShell concepts, explored slowly and deliberately

- `02-automation-patterns/`  
  Reusable patterns (logging, config, error handling, etc.)

- `03-identity-m365/`  
  Identity and access–related experiments and notes

- `04-tools/`  
  Small helper tools and entry scripts

- `99-snippets/`  
  Short notes, reminders, and one-liners

- `docs/`  
  Supporting notes and longer explanations

## Language note
Parts of this repository are written in Finnish.  
This is intentional — some notes are meant for personal clarity rather than external polish.

## Status
Active learning repository.  
Content evolves as understanding deepens.
