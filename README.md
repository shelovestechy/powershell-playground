# PowerShell Playground

A personal learning playground for PowerShell.

This repository is used to explore PowerShell fundamentals, test ideas, break things safely, and document patterns that are useful in real IT work.  
The focus is on clarity, repeatability, and understanding what actually happens under the hood.

## What this repo is
- A place to practice PowerShell in small, focused scripts
- Experiments with automation patterns (logging, config, error handling)
- Gradually shifting toward identity, access, and M365-related use cases

## What this repo is not
- A polished production module
- A copy-paste script dump
- A tutorial series

Scripts may be rewritten, refactored, or replaced as understanding improves.

## Principles
- Prefer objects over text
- Make scripts safe to re-run where possible
- Fail clearly when something goes wrong
- Document assumptions instead of hiding them
