## Random thoughts  

Short notes from real identity and access situations.  
Not theory.  
Just things that keep repeating.

If something sounds obvious, it probably wasn’t obvious the first time.

## Automated leavers  

On paper, leavers are simple.  

Account disabled.  
Access removed.  
Automation runs.

In reality, important documents and emails often live under one user account.

When that account is deleted, the identity lifecycle is finished.  
The data problem starts after.

---

Offboarding should not begin on the last working day.

There should be a clear checklist called  
**“Must do before you leave”**.

---

That checklist should cover:
- Move work documents to shared storage  
- Store files in agreed locations  
- Archive or move important emails to shared places  

---

Doing this early keeps access clean.  
Automation works.  
Nobody needs exceptions.

Keeping leaver accounts alive “just in case” defeats the point.  
It adds manual work and awkward follow-up.
