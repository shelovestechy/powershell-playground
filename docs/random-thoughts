##Random thoughts

Short notes from real identity and access situations.
Not theory. Not best-practice slides. Just things that keep showing up.

If something sounds obvious, it probably became obvious the hard way...

##Automated leavers

In identity lifecycle terms, leavers are simple.
An account is disabled. Access is removed. Data is handled according to policy.

In real life, users often store important work under their own account.
Documents live in personal folders.
Emails live only in one mailbox.

When the user leaves, the account and mailbox are deleted.
At that point, the identity lifecycle has already done its job.
The data problem arrives late.

This is why offboarding cannot start on the last working day.

There should be a clear and boring checklist called *“Must do before you leave”.*

It should include:

Move work documents to shared storage

Store important files in agreed locations

Archive or move important emails to shared mailboxes or folders

When this is done early, access stays clean.
Automation works as intended.
Nobody needs emergency exceptions.

Keeping leaver accounts alive “just in case” turns automation into a suggestion.
It also creates extra manual work and awkward questions like
“Can we keep this account for one more month?”

Good identity lifecycle design assumes people will forget.
Good processes plan for that and still work.
